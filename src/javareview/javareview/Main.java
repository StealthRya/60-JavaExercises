/*
 * Exercise 23
 * Write a Java program to enter a number and check whether the number is
 * perfect or not.
 * A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper
 * positive divisors.
 * For example: 6 is the first perfect number
 * The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3.
 * Sum of its divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
 * Therefore, 6 is a perfect number.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 24
 * Write a Java program to enter a number and calculate its factorial using a
 * for loop.
 * The factorial of a number "n" is the product of all positive integers less
 * than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.
 * For example, factorial of 5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.

/*
 * Exercise 25
 * Write a Java program to display all odd numbers from 1 to n using both for
 * and while loops.

/*
 * Exercise 27
 * Write a Java program to enter a number from the user and find the first and
 * last digit of the number using a loop.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 28
 * Write a Java program that reverses the digits of an integer N entered by the
 * user.
 * For example, if N = 35672, the output should be 27653.

/*
 * Exercise 29
 * Write a Java program to enter a number and calculate the sum of its digits
 * using a for loop.

/*
 * Exercise 36
 * Write a Java program to declare an array, then input its elements from the
 * user and count the number of even and odd elements in the array.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 37
 * Write a Java program to declare two arrays, then input the elements of the
 * first array from the user and copy all its elements into the second array.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 38
 * Create a Java program that creates and initializes an array, then inserts an
 * element at a specified position in this array (from 0 to N-1).
 * To insert a new element in the array, shift the elements from the given
 * insertion position one position to the right.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 39
 * Create a Java program that creates and initializes an array, then deletes an
 * element from this array at a specified position (from 0 to N-1).
 * To delete an element from the array, shift the elements just after the given
 * position one position to the left and reduce the array size.
